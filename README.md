# tcp-mail

Send encrypted messages over TCP.

This project is ment to be a learning experience rather than a real product. While it may prove to be secure enough to use, I do not guarantee this is the case or always will be the case, so use at your own risk.

Example:

```
$ mail-cli connect <URL>
```
